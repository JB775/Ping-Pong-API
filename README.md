Application Instructions:
* I used a PostgreSQL database, the database name for the API project is 'ping_pong_api' and the normal rails project is 'ping_pong_score'
* Prior to running server, please seed each database with the 'rake db:seed' command then run 'rake db:migrate'
* Run 'bundle install' to install all required gems
* You can just run each application's server like normal with 'rails s', the API's port has already been set to 3001
